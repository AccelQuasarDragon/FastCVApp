# Welcome to Fast CV App!

What is Fast CV App? Fast Computer Vision App is a small framework, guide, and examples about running Python code with multiprocessing from start to finish, beginning with `python main.py` and ending with an executable with PyInstaller on Windows and Mac.

Here you will learn know how to sidestep bottlenecks using multiprocessing and shared memory. Fast CV App was inspired by the ease and speed of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and while the decorator functionality of FastAPI is not available, rest assured that there are tutorials and examples to make a working CV App within 15 minutes.

# See for yourself:


Fast CV App is built on Kivy for the sole purpose of accessing OpenGL methods in Python without having to learn the ins and outs of OpenGL. This makes cross platform a lot more achievable and the same techniques you can learn here are applicable to any framework as long as you have access to a canvas and can update the canvas whenever you want. 

PyInstaller is used to create the Windows and MacOS (M1 chip) files, and associated .spec files are left in for examination.
