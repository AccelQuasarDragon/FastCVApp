# Welcome to Fast CV App!

Fast Computer Vision App (FCVA) is a small framework, guide, and examples about running Python code with multiprocessing from start to finish, beginning with `python main.py` and ending with creating an executable file with PyInstaller on Windows and Mac.

Here you will learn know how to sidestep bottlenecks using multiprocessing and shared memory. Fast CV App was inspired by the ease and speed of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and similarly there are tutorials and examples to make a working CV App within 15 minutes.

Fast CV App is built on Kivy for the sole purpose of accessing OpenGL methods in Python without having to learn the ins and outs of OpenGL. This makes cross platform targeting a lot more achievable. The same techniques you learn here are applicable to any framework as long as you have access to a canvas and can update the canvas whenever you want. 

PyInstaller is used to create the Windows and MacOS (M1 chip) files, and associated .spec files are left in for examination. 

# Initial setup: 
# Running examples:

This is an example repo that uses fastcvapp as a pypi module: 

https://github.com/AccelQuasarDragon/fcvaproject

To run, all you need to do is:

`git clone https://github.com/AccelQuasarDragon/fcvaproject`

`poetry update` OR `pip install -r requirements.txt`
